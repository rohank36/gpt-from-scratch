Ouputted "ELA" as a speaker during its training while you were showing it to Ela. ELA is not mentioned anywhere in the training data

Super werid that it came out. No mention of Ela as a word. Only one mention of ela as a subword in the whole input set: "delant"

Raises questions about interpretability of the model. 


The one thing going through my mind as I was learning about Transformers was that I should've paid more attention in uni Linear Algebra class
